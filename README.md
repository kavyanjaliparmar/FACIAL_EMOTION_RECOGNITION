# FACIAL_EMOTION_RECOGNITION
This project works by detecting emotions on the face using the CNN algorithm in real time. It first detects the face using the haar-cascade classifier and then on the identified face it predicts the emotion on it.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm designed primarily for image recognition, classification, and computer vision tasks. It works byu mimicing the behaviours of the human brain and hence perform the required classification tasks. It processes visual data by using layers of neurons that detect patterns in images and are then passed onto the further convolutional layers.
